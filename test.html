						<h2>Introducing the dating website
						<br />
						made exclusively for BCA students!</h2>
						<p> How many times have you been on a normal dating site? Okay, so the answer is probably "none." Even though you most likely haven't been on a dating site, you probably already know that dating sites are full of creepy people (who are possibly axe murderers) and people who fill their profiles with lies. Some people may not even be real! How many times have you wanted to talk to a love interest, but you were too nervous and/or socially awkward to do so? Unlike the last question, the answer to this one is probably "plenty of times." <br />
						This site offers a solution to all of those problems! On BCA Dating, you can be assured that the people who use this site are most likely not creepy axe murderers, and you can interact with people via the Internet, so you don't have to worry about messing up your chances with that individual. You also have more opportunities to interact with people who share the same interests as you. </p>
