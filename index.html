						<h2>Introducing the chat website
						<br />
						made exclusively for BCA students!</h2>
						<p> How's your social life going? The answer is probably not that well, right? We all say that a BCA student can only have two of the following things: good grades, extracurriculars, and a social life. As fellow BCA students, the Shaadi Girls know that the struggle is real. We have firsthand seen how all too often, we decide to eliminate the social life from our choices. But did you know that NOW you can keep your social life? That's right! The answer to all your social problems is here! Use BCA chat website! Brought to you by the Shaadi Girls, BCA Chat is a new, free website that will allow you to message fellow BCA alumni. You could message your friends, chat with new people, and if you are up for some fun you could even use our anonymous chat feature! Now you may be worried about your personal safety on this website. However, BCA chat is completely safe to use as ONLY BCA students can use it. In addition, most social media websites are blocked on the school's wifi. BCA Chat is there for other means of communication! Who knew that a social life was possible at a crazy school like BCA? </p>
