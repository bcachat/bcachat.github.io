						<h2>Introducing the chat website
						<br />
						made exclusively for BCA students!</h2>
						<p> Do you want to chat with kids from our school? Maybe talk anonymously or meet new people in BCA. Are you really annoyed that Facebook is blocked in school and you just want to message your friend. Well the answer to all your solutions is here! Use BCA chat website!!! BCA chat website is an all new and free website that will allow you to message kids from BCA. You could message your friends, chat with new people, make new friends, and if you are up for some fun you could even use our anonymous chat feature! Now you may be thinking that "there is something wrong with these kids", "why would anyone use this", "this is stupid an dangerous" however, BCA chat is perfectly safe as it is ONLY for BCA students. In addition most social media websites are blocked on the school's wifi so now BCA chat is available! And what other website is fun and safe enough to anonymously message other kids from BCA, or that will allow you to make friends with people from BCA? The answer is probably "none" which is why you should use the BCA chat!  </p>
